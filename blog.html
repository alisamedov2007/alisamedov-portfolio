                <p class="write">The internet is useful, but we must be safe. You can protect your accounts easily with simple habits. This is called Cybersecurity.</p>   
                <h3 class="simple">5 Simple Steps:</h3>
                <p class="write"><b>Strong Passwords:</b> Use a long password (over 12 characters). Do not use the same password for all sites. <br> <br>
                   <b>Use MFA (2-Factor Authentication):</b> This means you need your password and your phone to log in. Always turn it on! <br>  <br>
                   <b>Update Everything:</b> Update your computer and phone software often. Updates fix security problems. <br> <br>
                   <b>Think Before You Click (Phishing):</b> If an email looks strange or asks for a password, it is probably a fake. Do not click links from unknown senders. <br> <br>
                   <b>Be Careful on Wi-Fi:</b> Public Wi-Fi is not very safe. Do not do bank work or shopping on public Wi-Fi.</p>

                <h1 class="intro">Intro to HTML and CSS (Web Development)</h1>
                <p class="sentc">Do you want to build a website? You need two basic tools: HTML and CSS. HTML is the structure, and CSS is the style (the design).</p>
                <h3 class="word">HTML: The Foundation</h3>
                <p class="sentc">HTML (HyperText Markup Language) serves as the structural foundation of any web page. It determines the placement of content, such as text elements, images, and navigational links.</p>
                <h3 class="word">CSS: The Presentation Layer</h3>
                <p class="sentc">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is responsible for the visual presentation and aesthetics of the website. It controls critical design elements, including colors, typography, and layout arrangement. In web development, HTML defines the content and structure, while CSS manages the style and layout. They are both necessary for a complete website experience.</p>

                <p class="network">I am studying networking with Cisco NetAcad. This course helps me learn how the internet works from the basic level. The first and most important concept I learned is the IP Address.</p>
                <h3>IP Address Explained</h3>
                <p class="network">An IP Address is like a unique street address for a computer. Every device (your phone, laptop, or a server) needs this address to send and receive data online. The IP address has two main parts: the Network Part, which shows the general network it belongs to, and the Host Part, which identifies the specific device inside that network. Understanding the IP Address is the first key to understanding how we all connect online.</p>
